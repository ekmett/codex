const
=====

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/const.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/const)

This package provides a small shim around the data types and operations in `Foreign` and `Data.Primitive`
for emulating const-correctness from a C perspective.

In the future it'd be nice to have a proper const-cast that can handle nested ConstPtr's, etc. but this suffices
for my current usecases. Patches welcome!
