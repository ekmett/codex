[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/harfbuzz-freetype.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/harfbuzz-freetype)

Harfbuzz is a text shaping library that takes a sequence of unicode codepoints and a font, and selects a sequence of glyphs and placements for
those glyphs to represent the desired text. 

FreeType is a library that works with various font formats to extract glyph shapes and render images.

This package provides additional interoperability between harfbuzz and FreeType 2.
