[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/harfbuzz.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/harfbuzz)

Harfbuzz is a text shaping library that takes a sequence of unicode codepoints and a font, and selects a sequence of glyphs and placements for
those glyphs to represent the desired text. This presupposes things like breaking text into manageable fragments, and the something like the
unicode bidirectional algorithm has already processed the data.

This package is intended to provide Haskell bindings to that library.
