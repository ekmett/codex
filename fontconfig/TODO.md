# TODO

* Add `patternGet`
* Add missing methods for config, etc.
* Add the `ftfreetype` methods? Or do we want to cut that out into a separate lib?
* Build an end-to-end example of this actually working, possibly with a custom config and some local font files for reproducibility
* Build a test suite
