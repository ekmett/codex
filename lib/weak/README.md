weak
====

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/weak.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/weak)

This package supplies extras for working with weak pointers in Haskell. In particular this
allows creation of a weak pointer using a `ForeignPtr` as a key more robustly. In the future
this may extend to allow more types of objects with heap identity (such as the types in
`primitive`) to form robust weak pointers.
