  Wrapper around FreeType 2 library.  Relevant

  .
  What is FreeType 2?
  .
  FreeType 2 is a software font engine that is
  designed to be small, efficient, highly
  customizable, and portable while capable of
  producing high-quality output (glyph images). It
  can be used in graphics libraries, display
  servers, font conversion tools, text image
  generation tools, and many other products as
  well.
  .
  The following is a non-exhaustive list of
  features provided by FreeType 2.
  .
  * FreeType 2 provides a simple and easy-to-use
  API to access font content in a uniform way,
  independently of the file format. Additionally,
  some format-specific APIs can be used to access
  special data in the font file.
  .
  * Unlike most comparable libraries, FreeType 2
  supports scalable font formats like TrueType or
  Type 1 natively and can return the outline data
  (and control instructions/hints) to client
  applications.
  .
  By default, FreeType 2 supports the following
  font formats.
  .
  * TrueType fonts (and collections)
  .
  * Type 1 fonts
  .
  * CID-keyed Type 1 fonts
  .
  * CFF fonts
  .
  * OpenType fonts (both TrueType and CFF variants)
  .
  * SFNT-based bitmap fonts
  .
  * X11 PCF fonts
  .
  * Windows FNT fonts
  .
  * BDF fonts (including anti-aliased ones)
  .
  * PFR fonts
  .
  * Type 42 fonts (limited support)
  .
  From a given glyph outline, FreeType 2 is capable
  of producing a high-quality monochrome bitmap, or
  anti-aliased pixmap, using 256 levels of
  'gray'. This is much better than the 5 levels
  used by Windows 9x\/98\/NT\/2000 or FreeType 1.
  .
  FreeType 2 supports all the character mappings
  defined by the TrueType and OpenType
  specification. It is also capable of
  automatically synthetizing a Unicode charmap from
  Type 1 fonts, which puts an end to the painful
  'encoding translation' headache common with this
  format (of course, original encodings are also
  available in the case where you need them).
  .
  The FreeType 2 core API provides simple functions
  to access advanced information like glyph names
  or kerning data.
  .
  FreeType 2 provides information that is often not
  available from other similar font engines, like
  kerning distances, glyph names, vertical metrics,
  etc.
  .
  FreeType 2 provides its own caching subsystem
  since release 2.0.1. It can be used to cache
  either face instances or glyph images
  efficiently.
